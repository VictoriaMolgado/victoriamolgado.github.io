            Context
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Bravado is a company focused on helping salespeople 
            succeed in their careers ‚Äî from helping them landing 
            a new job to offering a space where they can ask 
            questions to a community, or share their learns, 
            the Bravado Community. The community offered total 
            anonimity to it‚Äôs members.
        </p>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Salespeople need a space to be honest about how they 
            feel about their work lifes. Choosing when to share ther 
            real identity is part of that. But taking credits for the 
            content they were creating was also important to their carrers.

        <h6>Community optional anonymity</h6>
        <h4>
            To learn and share with the community, users must be able 
            to switch between identites whenever they want
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            It was strategic for the company that users could still 
            not disclose their real identities when posting or commenting. 
            At the same time, we wanted the members to be able to take 
            professional credits on the content they create for the 
            plataform. It should be very easy and accessible to create 
            content with any identity at any moment.

                <h5>Company goal</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    The leadership came up with the need to engage new 
                    users in the Community. They wanted to allow users 
                    to use their real identities where, previously, they 
                    could only use an anonymous ones.

                <img class="principle-icon" src="assets/imgs/in/02-scope.svg" alt="">
                <h5>My approach</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    I started with a low-fidelity design following the first idea: 
                    allow users to switch profiles. I also proposed a different 
                    approach ‚Äî there could be an anonymous forum, but we could 
                    also have others that would require a real identity.
                </p>
            </div>

                <img class="principle-icon" src="assets/imgs/in/03-scope.svg" alt="">
                <h5>User testing</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    I tested the concepts with users and both were clearly 
                    understood. There were no preferences from the user‚Äôs 
                    perspectives, nor a version with better or worse usability.

                <h5>Final decision</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    We decided to allow users to switch profiles to perform 
                    specific interactions. It would ensure the right amount 
                    of content being created, as well as help people to share 
                    sensitive information using the anonymous profile if they wanted.

        <h6>Solution</h6>
        <h4>I added the profile switcher nearby the interaction 
            users will take, and established that we should save 
            their last profile choice as the default
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Most users don‚Äôt post or comment. It was not necessary to show a 
            switcher to the ‚Äúpassive‚Äù users. Given our scenario, it was better 
            to have shortcuts to switch nearby the interaction.

        <h4>
            Why not‚Ä¶
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            When reading this case, you may wonder about some decisions. 
            It‚Äôs important to remember that we were a startup and we had 
            to move fast ‚Äî there was no time to discuss many different versions, 
            but I made sure to explore a few before deciding to pursue that one.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>
                Why not just allow people to ‚Äúpost anonymously‚Äù or not, 
                removing the need to switch?
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    The community's main profiles were anonymous profiles. 
                    We still needed to list the posts they wrote when under 
                    this pseudonym. As they could have shared private info, 
                    we should keep it that way.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Why not separate the communities? If you want to be anonymous, 
                you have a forum. If you want to use a real identity, you have another.
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    This was the most explored idea, at least from my side. 
                    But, in the end, the company was not sure we‚Äôd have 
                    enough users to ensure the content would be created on 
                    more than one forum daily. 
                </p>
            </li> 
            <li>
                Why not have a global switcher?
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    Even though this is common, the stakeholders were not 
                    confident that users would see and learn that switching 
                    profiles on the top-right of the page (for example) would 
                    change the profile they are commenting with

        <h4>Final considerations</h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Switching profiles inside comment and post interactions 
            could not be the ideal solution. But considering the 
            resources and the timeline (three weeks to design desktop, 
            mobile web, and app), it was a good tool to learn about the 
            user‚Äôs reaction to the new feature.
