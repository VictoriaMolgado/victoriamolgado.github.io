            Context
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Bravado is a company focused on helping salespeople 
            succeed in their careers ‚Äî from helping them landing 
            a new job to offering a space where they can ask 
            questions to a community, or share their learns, 
            the Bravado Community. The community offered total 
            anonimity to it‚Äôs members.
        </p>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Salespeople need a space to be honest about how they 
            feel about their work lifes. Choosing when to share ther 
            real identity is part of that. But taking credits for the 
            content they were creating was also important to their carrers.
        </p>

    <div class="text-container">
        <h6>Community optional anonymity</h6>
        <h4>
            To learn and share with the community, users must be able 
            to switch between identites whenever they want
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            It was strategic for the company that users could still 
            not disclose their real identities when posting or commenting. 
            At the same time, we wanted the members to be able to take 
            professional credits on the content they create for the 
            plataform. It should be very easy and accessible to create 
            content with any identity at any moment.

                <h5>Company goal</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    The leadership wanted to engage new users in the Community
                    using real identities instead of anonymous ones.
                </p>
            </div>

                <img class="principle-icon" src="assets/imgs/in/02-scope.svg" alt="">
                <h5>My approach</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    I proposed two approachs: (1) allow users to switch profiles 
                    in key interactions as commenting or (2) have some forums 
                    require real identities while others remain anonymous.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="principle">
                <img class="principle-icon" src="assets/imgs/in/03-scope.svg" alt="">
                <h5>User testing</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    User testing showed both concepts were equally understandable and usable.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="principle">
                <img class="principle-icon" src="assets/imgs/in/03-scope.svg" alt="">
                <h5>Final decision</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    We decided to allow users to switch profiles to perform 
                    specific interactions (approach 1). Ensuring enough content 
                    creation and enabling anonymous sharing for sensitive information.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
        <h6>Solution</h6>
        <h4>I added the profile switcher nearby the interaction 
            users will take, and established that we should save 
            their last profile choice as the default
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Most users don‚Äôt post or comment. It was not necessary to show a 
            switcher to the ‚Äúpassive‚Äù users. Given our scenario, it was better 
            to have shortcuts to switch nearby the interaction.

        <h4>
            Why not‚Ä¶
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            When reading this case, you may wonder about some decisions. 
            It‚Äôs important to remember that we were a startup and we had 
            to move fast ‚Äî there was no time to discuss many different versions, 
            but I made sure to explore a few before deciding to pursue that one.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>
                Why not just allow people to ‚Äúpost anonymously‚Äù or not, 
                removing the need to switch?
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    The community's main profiles were anonymous profiles. 
                    We still needed to list the posts they wrote when under 
                    this pseudonym. As they could have shared private info, 
                    we should keep it that way.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Why not separate the communities? If you want to be anonymous, 
                you have a forum. If you want to use a real identity, you have another.
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    This was the most explored idea, at least from my side. 
                    But, in the end, the company was not sure we‚Äôd have 
                    enough users to ensure the content would be created on 
                    more than one forum daily. 
                </p>
            </li> 
            <li>
                Why not have a global switcher?
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    Even though this is common, the stakeholders were not 
                    confident that users would see and learn that switching 
                    profiles on the top-right of the page (for example) would 
                    change the profile they are commenting with

        <h4>Final considerations</h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Switching profiles inside comment and post interactions 
            could not be the ideal solution. But considering the 
            resources and the timeline (three weeks to design desktop, 
            mobile web, and app), it was a good tool to learn about the 
            user‚Äôs reaction to the new feature.
