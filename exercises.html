    <h3>Descomplica Exercise tools</h3>
    <div class="project-context">
        <div class="h6 disciplines">Product Design, UI, UX, Research, Concept</div>
    </div>
    <div class="project-intro">
        In May 2018 I and my small startup-team were acquired by Descomplica, 
        one of the biggest edtechs in Brazil. Our mission was extinguishing 
        the exercise features deficits of the online classes platform. 
        In one year we delivered three products: Exercises tool, Exams, and Essays. 
    </div>
    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        We worked with two needs of Brazilians 
        studying to get on a university: training and diagnostics. 
    </p>
    <h5>Diagnostics: The exams experience</h5>
    <p class="article-text">
        It was our first release by the name of the company: an open 
        and free tool for simulating entrance exams and evaluate their performances. 
    </p>
    <h5>Exercises tool: The training experience</h5>
    <p class="article-text">
        Someone who's preparing for entrance exams should learn the exam's 
        characteristics and answering timing. That's why we create a tool 
        with exercise lists per subject - with a maximum of 10 questions, 
        a shorter feedback cycle than students are used to and giving 
        the sensation of productivity. 
    </p>
    <h5>Essays: A strategic skill for students</h5>
    <p class="article-text">
        Our last product created together was a tool for students to 
        write and send essays to be evaluated by a pedagogic team of 
        correctors. It was a new experience to replace an embedded 
        service that adapts itself to receive many corrections styles and 
        communicating just one of them for the student.
    </p>
     <h4>The students</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        In a universe of 200 thousand users, we had a lot of user profiles. 
        Our User Studies team synthesis them in six personas. 
        In the Exercises team, we focused on two of them - by biases they 
        where the public with training time in their routine: students who 
        use Descomplica as a periodic study platform, students that watched 
        live classes every day. 
    </p>
    <h4>The Exercises feature path - our hypothesis</h4>
        <p class="article-text">
            Due to the users' expectations about the tools, 
            we explored more te Exercise problems because of 
            its absence of how-it-should-work expectations. 
            We started with the hypothesis that shorter exercise 
            cycles and smaller questions would ensure more practice 
            for the students, engaged by the objectivity of the interaction.  
        </p>
    <h4>One year learning</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        With the product in the market in three months 
        of conception and implementation, I had one year to test it 
        with users. We also had a fixed feedback field on the main page, 
        and that how I discovered that our proposition wasn't valuable 
        for a significant number of users. 
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">In this scenario, while my team worked to develop and ship the 
        Essays feature I started an internal personal project to rethink 
        the exercises experience to be more generic to users cases.
    </p>
    <h4>Infinity list</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        In a few months we already knew three problems in our product:
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        With this well knew pain points mapped, I resorted to ad 
        old teams' idea: the experience of sequential questions, 
        configured by the student, showing questions based on 
        the previous answers and without a specified number 
        of questions: infintiy.
    </p>
    <h4>Today's experience</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Unfortunately, this feature is not implemented yet.  
        All of Descomplica's experience is being recreated 
        by the product team, under new product guidelines. 
        Meanwhile, I and part of this project team moved 
        to a new Business Unity. We continued to work with 
        exercises and hope to use what we learned here for the future.
