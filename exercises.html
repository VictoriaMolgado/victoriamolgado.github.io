        In May 2018 I and my small startup-team were acquired by Descomplica, 
        one of the biggest edtechs in Brazil. Our mission was extinguishing 
        the exercise features deficits of the online classes platform. 
        In one year we delivered three products: Exercises tool, Exams, and Essays. 
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
        <h4>Diagnostics, training and strategic skills</h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            My team and I worked with two needs of Brazilians students to prepare 
            for university entrance exams: exams skill training and knowledge diagnoses. 
        </p>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            In this case, well see more of the exercises and training 
            tools for which I was the only responsible designer. 
        </p>

    <div class="text-container">
        <h4>Our students</h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            In a universe of 200 thousand users, we had a lot of profiles. 
            Our research team synthesis them in six personas. In our team, 
            we focused on two: students who use Descomplica as a periodical 
            study platform and students that watched live classes every day, as a course.
            They are naturally our features' early adopters because they have more 
            time dedicated to exercises than the other personas.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
        <h4>The Exercises feature path - our hypothesis</h4>
            <p class="sans-serif-text">
                We explored more the training problems because of the 
                nonexistence of how-it-should-work expectations. 
                We started with the hypothesis that shorter exercise 
                cycles and smaller questions would ensure more practice 
                for the students, engaged by the simplicity of the studying task. 
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
        <h4>One year learning and researching</h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            We launched the "exercises" product, Dex, after three months 
            of conception and implementation, after that I had one year 
            to test it with users. We also had a fixed feedback field on 
            the main page, and that's how I discovered that our proposition 
            wasn't valuable for a significant number of users (more about 
            the pain points to follow).
        </p>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            In this scenario, while my team worked to develop and ship other 
            features I started an internal personal project to rethink the 
            exercises experience to be more generic to users cases.

        <h4>Endless list</h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            In a few months we already knew three problems in our hypothesis:    
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>
                The questions were too easy and solving 
                them did not give any learning perception; 
            </li>
            <li>
                Find questions that provided the challenges the students needed 
                to train was hard: all the questions where inside lists;
            </li> 
            <li>
                The lists were considered too short by the students: 
                they wanted more questions. 
            </li> 
        </ul> 
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            With this well knew pain points outlined, I resorted to an 
            old idea of my team: the experience of sequential questions, 
            configured by the student, showing questions based on the previous 
            answers and without a specified number of questions - Endless.

            On this new experience the student would have all questions

        The infinity list takes all the questions about a 
        topic and enables the students to filter over them,

            Unfortunately, this feature is not implemented yet.  
            All of Descomplica's experience is being recreated 
            by the product team, under new product guidelines. 
            Meanwhile, I and part of this project team moved 
            to a new Business Unity. We continued to work with 
            exercises and hope to use what we learned here for the future.
