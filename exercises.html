    <h3>Infinity list studying tool</h3>
    <div class="project-context">
        <div class="h6 disciplines">Product Design, UI, UX, Research, Concept</div>
    </div>
    <div class="project-intro">
        In May 2018 I and my small startup-team were acquired by Descomplica, 
        one of the biggest edtechs in Brazil. Our mission was extinguishing 
        the exercise features deficits of the online classes platform. 
        In one year we delivered three products: Exercises tool, Exams, and Essays. 
    </div>
    <h4>Diagnostics, training and strategic skills</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        We worked with two needs of Brazilians students to prepare 
        for university entrance exams: exams skill training and knowledge diagnoses. 
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        In this case, well see more of the exercises and training 
        tools for which I was the only responsible designer. 
    </p>
     <h4>Our students</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        In a universe of 200 thousand users, we had a lot of profiles. 
        Our research team synthesis them in six personas. In our team, 
        we focused on two: students who use Descomplica as a periodical 
        study platform and students that watched live classes every day, as a course. 
    </p>
    <h4>The Exercises feature path - our hypothesis</h4>
        <p class="article-text">
            We explored more the training problems because of the 
            nonexistence of how-it-should-work expectations. 
            We started with the hypothesis that shorter exercise 
            cycles and smaller questions would ensure more practice 
            for the students, engaged by the simplicity of the studying task. 
        </p>
    <h4>One year learning and researching</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        We launched the product after three months of conception and 
        implementation, after that I had one year to test it with users. 
        We also had a fixed feedback field on the main page, and that's how 
        I discovered that our proposition wasn't valuable for a significant 
        number of users (more about it in the "Infinity list"). 
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        In this scenario, while my team worked to develop and ship other 
        features I started an internal personal project to rethink the 
        exercises experience to be more generic to users cases.
    </p>
    <h4>Infinity list</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        In a few months we already knew three problems in our hypothesis:    
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
            The questions were too easy and solving 
            them did not give any learning perception; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Find questions that provided the challenges the students needed 
            to train was hard: all the questions where inside lists;
        </li> 
        <li>
            The lists were considered too short by the students: 
            they wanted more questions. 
        </li> 
     </ul> 
    <p class="article-text">
        With this well knew pain points outlined, I resorted to an 
        old idea of my team: the experience of sequential questions, 
        configured by the student, showing questions based on the previous 
        answers and without a specified number of questions - infinity. 
    </p>

        </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="source">
        We wanted to allow students to build their own path. 
        The infinity list takes all the questions about a 
        topic and enables the students to filter over them.
    </div>
    <h4>Today's experience</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Unfortunately, this feature is not implemented yet.  
        All of Descomplica's experience is being recreated 
        by the product team, under new product guidelines. 
        Meanwhile, I and part of this project team moved 
        to a new Business Unity. We continued to work with 
        exercises and hope to use what we learned here for the future.
