        The Brazilian pharmaceutical industry suffers from billionaire 
        losses caused by not preventing the waste of refrigerated medicines. 
        To solve this geographic and cultural real-life problem I created Termostatus: 
        my graduation final project.

        <h4>Scenario & summary</h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Brazil's continental dimensions and its highway based logistic 
            system leads to danger to Brazilian health - cargos of refrigerated 
            medicines can be lost by excessive hotness, humidity variations and 
            inadequate exposure to light.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
        <h4>Law and regulation</h4>
         <p class="sans-serif-text">
             That's why Anvisa established that this system should have a periodic 
             registration of the refrigeration conditions. This registering process 
             is many times maintained by an employee responsible by noting them on a 
             paper, from time to time - our proto-persona Vera. Automatizing this 
             work means more productive work time to Vera and money saving for the industry.

        <h4>Them, the human beings of the case</h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            To keep in mind who would contract our SaaS and who would use 
            it every day, I created two proto-personas: Vera, the responsible by checking 
            the refrigerators during the day and Ana Clara, our buyer, a manager that doesn't 
            want to risk her refrigerated products.

                monitoring temperature, humidity and light exposure based 
                on IoT: a dispositive collect temperature data by refrigerator 
                and generates automatically the  reports demanded by Anvisa.

            <h4>After mapping the problem, it was branding time</h4>
            <p class="sans-serif-text">
                Once the problem and public were well established I moved 
                to the question "how its gonna be the communication with 
                someone who maybe feels replaceable?". Its was clear that the 
                brand needed to be made for them and its first version was developed 
                with three principles:

            The logotype was developed with animistic characteristics and applied 
            to the sensor's body, working and a face, a friendly little monster who
            took care of the temperature.

            Whe had no brandbook. To keep consistence,
            all the communication assets should be done using 
            the first version of the UI Style Guide - 
            a embrion of and design system.

                After the discovery of what could solve the problem and how 
                the brand communicates I moved to discover the product possibilities. 
                In the end, I bet on offering the possibility to watch the refrigerators' 
                conditions per sensor. The focus was on the use cases:
