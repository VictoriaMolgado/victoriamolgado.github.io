        The Brazilian pharmaceutical industry suffers from billionaire 
        losses caused by not preventing the waste of refrigerated medicines. 
        To solve this geographic and cultural real-life problem I created Termostatus: 
        my graduation final project.
    </div>

        <h4>Scenario & summary</h4>
        <p class="article-text">
            Brazil's continental dimensions and its highway based logistic 
            system leads to danger to Brazilian health - cargos of refrigerated 
            medicines can be lost by excessive hotness, humidity variations and 
            inadequate exposure to light.
        </p>
        <h4>Law and regulation</h4>
         <p class="article-text">
             That's why Anvisa established that this system should have a periodic 
             registration of the refrigeration conditions. This registering process 
             is many times maintained by an employee responsible by noting them on a 
             paper, from time to time - our proto-persona Vera. Automatizing this 
             work means more productive work time to Vera and money saving for the industry.
        </p>
        <h4>Them, the human beings</br>of the case</h4>
        <p class="article-text">
            To keep in mind who would contract our SaaS and who would use 
            it every day, I created two proto-personas: Vera, the responsible by checking 
            the refrigerators during the day and Ana Clara, our buyer, a manager that doesn't 
            want to risk her refrigerated products.

        <p class="article-text">
            Termostatus was created to make Vera and Ana Clara 
            workday better and to ensure the quality of the Brazilian distribution of cold drugs.
        </p>
 

        <h4>A sensor is born ‚≠ê</h4>
        <p class="article-text">We would offer an online service for monitoring temperature, humidity and light exposure based on IoT: a dispositive collect temperature data by refrigerator and generates automatically the  reports demanded by Anvisa. 
           </p>


        <h4>After mapping the problem, it was branding time</h4>
        <p class="article-text">
            Once the problem and public were well established I moved 
            to the question "how its gonna be the communication with 
            someone who maybe feels replaceable?". Its was clear that the 
            brand needed to be made for them and its first version was developed 
            with three principles: 
        </p>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <p class="article-text">
            The logotype was developed with animistic characteristics and applied 
            to the sensor's body, working and a face, a friendly little monster who
            took care of the temperature. 
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">
            Whe had no brandbook. To keep consistence,
            all the communication assets should be done using 
            the first version of the UI Style Guide - 
            a embrion of and design system.

        <p class="article-text">
            The brand should feel to our users like a character they interact with. 
            I wanted the to feel connection and affection for Termostatus' hardware. 
            Our logotype has animistic characteristics, to invite people to bound with it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-eye">
            "Animism stimulates the same part of the brain that gets 
            excited by cute cats and puppy love. [...] centers on 
            our fantasy that technology can learn us, rather than our having to learn it."

        <h4>The product itself</h4>
        <p class="article-text">
            After the discovery of what could solve the problem and how 
            the brand communicates I moved to discover the product possibilities. 
            In the end, I bet on offering the possibility to watch the refrigerators' 
            conditions per sensor. The focus was on the use cases:

        From left to right: sign-up flow, 
        data visualization layers, and alarm settings.</p>
    <h4>User interface</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Mostly a status visualization, the interface was simple and straightforward. 
        Its function is to inform the refrigerator status with elegance and simplicity. </p>

    <h4>Next step</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Invalidate hypothesis applied to the business model, in the brand, 
        and the interface by doing user interviews with pharmaceutics - 
        the people who would interact with our service every day and 
        with who contracts our service.
