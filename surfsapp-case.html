    <h3>Surfsapp</h3>
    <div class="project-context">
        <div class="disciplines">Product Concept, UI, UX, Information Design</div>
        <div class="project-details">Jan 2018</div>
    </div>
    <div class="project-intro">
        Surfing challenges go far beyond the sport technique. To learn the sea 
        conditions is a skill that takes time to develop, Surfsapp proposes 
        more accessible sea forecast to surf beginners and led them to learn from it. 
    </div>
    <h4>Project context</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Planing a surf day can be fundamental to many surfers, with all experience 
        levels, and when they check sea forecast usually will found complex data visualization.
    </p>
    <h4>More than forecasting, we need diagnoses</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Beyond the graphic information overload, beginners may 
        have interpretation problems with the information itself, 
        see the content and ask: in what the wave speed influences 
        when I'm surfing? With this, came the hypothesis: show the 
        sea forecasting and explain it's components and how to use de data.
    </p>
    <h4>Public mapping</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        To learn the mental model of our target market and ensure product 
        and communication consistency  I applied a survey and a card sorting 
        study. With the first, I intended to have some visibility of what 
        was the hardest information to read and with the second, I would 
        create the information architecture of the minimum product to deliver value.
    </p>
    <h4>Our surfers</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
            To the MVP, I choose to focus on surf beginners.  
            Centered the content didactic on them, represented in 
            this project by Bruna, our main proto-persona - we 
            should ensure that she would never go to the beach without clear forecasting.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        Besides the more explanatory vein of the content, intermediary 
        and advanced surfers could gain time with a more simple forecast 
        visualization. To represent them, we have our proto-persona Juliano.

    <h4>Creating the product</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Once I defined the problem was forecasting interpretation 
        and learning for surf beginners, I established three foundations:
    </p> 
    <ul class="bullet-list">  
        <li>
            We'll tell only what is relevant to 
            the decision to go or not to go surf;
        </li> 
        <li>Insights matter more than charts;</li>
        <li>
            We'll avoid niche language and only use them 
            when followed by the explanation of what they mean.
        </li> 
    </ul>
    <p class="article-text">
        I started some flow and interface structure sketchs.
    </p> 
    <div class="horizontal-image-grid">
        <figure class="horizontal-grid horizontal_item--1">
             <img src="assets/imgs/surfsapp/fluxos-min-min.png"/>
        </figure>
        <figure class="horizontal-grid  horizontal_item--2">
                <img src="assets/imgs/surfsapp/interface-min-min.png"/>
        </figure>
        <figure class="horizontal-grid  horizontal_item--3">

    </figure>

    <div class="source">
        Putting ideias on paper.
    </div>
    <p class="article-text">
        At the end of the drafting process, 
        I came to a navigation architecture.
    </p> 
    <div class="single-images">
        <figure>
            <img class="solo" src="assets/imgs/surfsapp/information-architecture-min.png" alt="Surfsapp user flow"/>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <h4>Identity and consistency</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        To compose the values and principles of the value propose I 
        developed a few illustrations, to ensure visual identity. 
    </p>
    <div class="single-images">
        <figure>
            <img class="solo" src="assets/imgs/surfsapp/assets-min.png" alt="Surfsapp user flow"/>

        <figure>
            <img class="solo" src="assets/imgs/surfsapp/ilustrations-min.png" alt="Surfsapp user flow"/>

    </div>
    <div class="source">
        A few recorrent forecasts illustrated in the embrionary brand style 
        already applied on the interface.
    </div>
    <h4>The result</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        The biggest experience challenge was to make sure that 
        the user wouldn't drown in information - as in the 
        other forecasting visualizations. So, I developed a 
        direct-to-the-point approach, with the option to go deeper into the data.  
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        The macro visualization of the forecasting and the 
        possibility to go to the micro.
    </p>
    <div class="single-images">
        <figure>

        The main screen and all the layers of interaction. In the end, 
        a possible extra feature: calculate the setting of the perfect surfboard for you.
    </div>
    <h4>Next steps</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Far from the forecasting, we could offer lifestyle 
        content as clothing tips and equipment. One example 
        is this surfboard calculator concept that uses 
        information about you to suggest the best surfboard model. 
    </p>
     <p class="article-text">
        Surfsapp was conceived as a PWA. There was also the 
        possibility to create a browser plugin to be where the surfer is. 
    </p>
