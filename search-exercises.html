    <h3>Exercises searching tool</h3>
    <div class="project-context">
        <div class="h6 disciplines">Product Design, UI, UX, Research</div>
    </div>
    <div class="project-intro">
        Brazilian teachers have 12 hours per day work routines: 
        it doesn't end in the classrooms and goes home with them, occupying their personal lives. 
        The Questions Searcher was created to give their time back.
    </div>
    <h4>The beginning</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        In December 2019 I was invited to the first B2B team of Descomplica, 
        to work with schools. We started facing the challenge of the fresh business 
        model and a new universe of problems and opportunities making teacher's lives better. 
        After all, they are who choose which pedagogic assets integrate the school and the classroom.
    </p>
    <h4>Our problem and opportunity</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Teachers take their work home and don't have time for themselves. We decided to attack this issue 
        by reducing the effort of creating exams and training material for students: a task that involves a 
        long Google search.
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        We had two months to develop the product, investigate the solution value to the 
        users and, through this, observe how the teacher would see the Descomplica.
    </p>
    <h4>Benchmark and scope construction</h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        I started the project analyzing the most relevant questions search tool on the marketing, the SuperPro. 
        Beyond dissecting its architecture I asked teachers that already used SuperPro to explain to me how the product works. 
        With this, I mapped their mental model when creating exams and training lists. 
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        After mapping, I started taking to the paper the central interactions.
    </p>
    <div class="horizontal-image-grid">
        <figure class="horizontal-grid horizontal_item--1">
             <img src="assets/imgs/criar-exercicio.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <figure class="horizontal-grid  horizontal_item--2">
                <img src="assets/imgs/filtre-por-assunto.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <figure class="horizontal-grid  horizontal_item--3">

    </div>
    <div class="source">
        Wireframing the problem to visualize the main interactions
    </div>
    <p class="article-text">
        Our product would have five main interactions:</p> 
        <ul class="bullet-list">
           <li>Search by topic;</li>
           <li>Filtering and selecting;</li> 
           <li>Selection edditing;</li> 
           <li>Save and share digital exercise list;</li> 
           <li>Visualize answers</li>
        </ul> 
    <p class="article-text">
        We didn't have much time, so I decided to align the scope with high-fidelity wireframes.
    </p>
    <div class="horizontal-image-grid">
        <figure class="horizontal-grid horizontal_item--1">
            <img src="assets/imgs/home-buscador-wire-min.png"/>
       </figure>
       <figure class="horizontal-grid  horizontal_item--2">
               <img src="assets/imgs/filtragem-buscador-wire-min.png"/>
       </figure>
       <figure class="horizontal-grid  horizontal_item--3">

    </div>
    <h4>The challenges of the experience</h4>
    <h5>Navigation in our pedagogic system</h5>
    <p class="article-text">
        What happens if that user searches for a therm different than the Descomplica's pedagogic system? 
        To prevent confusion, the search tool also has navigation by discipline.
    </p>
    <div class="single-images">
        <figure>
            <img class="solo" src="assets/imgs/buscador/search-grid-min.png" alt="Search feature wireframe and screens"/>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="source">
        From left to right: high-fidelity wireframes and the result - search links and discipline navigation.
    </div>
    <h5>Filtering for questions</h5>
    <p class="article-text">
        The Benchmark and some user interviews showed us the clear necessity of a robust filtering experience. 
        Each discipline, classroom, and school demanded specific approaches in the tasks. 
        After some experiment UI experiments and heuristic evaluation, 
        we decided on an always visible filtering feature.
    </p>

        <figure>
            <img class="solo" src="assets/imgs/buscador/filtering-grid-min.png" alt="Filtering step wireframe and screens"/>
        </figure>
    </div>
     <div class="source">
        From left to right: wireframes with possible 
        filter interfaces and the final choice. 
     </div>
    <h5>Sharing and applying</h5>
    <p class="article-text">
        The Searcher itself is a simple product, but the offline exercises application flow is a delicate point. 
        We're instructing them in detail because we know that an unfocused classroom can be bad for our product.
    </p>
    <div class="single-images">
        <figure>
            <img class="solo" src="assets/imgs/buscador/sharing-grid-min.png" alt="Sharing section wireframe and screens"/>
        </figure>
    </div>
   <div class="source">We started with a possible saving modal, 
       but we're trying to padronize interactions like this in fullscreen. 
       Also considered a page tho edit and save in the same moment, 
       but the flows where different enough to be separated.
    </div>
     <h4>First UI version</h4>
     <div class="single-images">

        Most of the components used on the UI come from a shared library. 
        Here are the new ones, created for the search tool.

    <h4>Discoveries and the future</h4>
        <p class="article-text">
            With the user interviews that I conducted during the development phase, 
            we discovered that the absence of interest in bringing technology to the 
            classroom may be a myth. We have the hypothesis that the time to discover 
            and learn about digital tools is the real problem. In this scenario, 
            I'm working in an experiment to empower teachers to use Descomplica tools: the Descomplica Methodologies.
