        Brazilian teachers have 12 hours per day work routines: 
        the work also occupies their personal lives, this tool 
        was created to give their time back. I was the only designer 
        responsible for this product, working with two and a half developers.
    </div>
    <h6>Context</h6>
    <h4>The search tool is the first product my team built 
        in the Descomplica's new business unity: products 
        for schools
    </h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        In December 2019 I was invited to the first B2B team of Descomplica. 
        We started facing the challenge of the fresh business model and a 
        new universe of problems and opportunities to make teacher's lives better. 
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        After all, teachers are the ones who choose which 
        pedagogic assets integrate the school and the classroom.
    </p>
    <h6>Our problem and opportunity</h6>
    <h4>School teachers take their work home and 
        don't have time for themselves or to improve their skills
    </h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        We decided to attack this issue by reducing the effort of creating 
        exams and training material for students: a work that involves a long 
        Google search. We had two months to develop the product, investigate 
        the solution value to the users and, through this, observe how the 
        teacher would see the Descomplica.
    </p>
    <h6>First release timeline</h6>

    </p>
    <h6>Benchmark and scope construction</h6>
    <h4>
        I started the project Benchmarking the most relevant questions search tool 
        on the marketing and watching teachers using it
    </h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        When analyzing SuperPro I examined its architecture and I asked teachers 
        that already used it to show me how the product works. With this, 
        I mapped their mental model when creating exams and training lists. 
    </p>
    <p class="article-text">
        After mapping, I started taking to the paper the central interactions.

            <img class="solo" src="assets/imgs/buscador/searcher-flow.svg" alt=""/>

    </div>
    <p class="article-text">
        Our product would have five main interactions:
    </p> 
        <ul class="bullet-list">
           <li>Search by topic;</li>
           <li>Filtering and selecting;</li> 
           <li>Selection edditing;</li> 
           <li>Save and share digital exercise list;</li> 
           <li>Visualize answers</li>
        </ul> 
    <p class="article-text">
        We didn't have much time, so I decided to align the scope with high-fidelity wireframes.
    </p>
    <div class="horizontal-image-grid">
        <figure class="horizontal-grid horizontal_item--1">

    <h6>The challenges of the experience ✢ Search and navigation</h6>
    <h4>
        Navigation in our pedagogic system: what happens if a user searches 
        for a therm different than the ones we use in our pedagogic system? 
    </h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        To prevent confusion, the search tool also has navigation by discipline.
    <div class="single-images">
        <figure>
            <img class="solo" src="assets/imgs/buscador/search-grid-min.png" alt="Search feature wireframe and screens"/>

    </div>
    <div class="source">
        From left to right: high-fidelity wireframes and 
        the result - search links and discipline navigation.
    </div>
    <h6>Filtering for questions</h6>
    <h4>
        The need for a robust filtering experience was clear to us since the Benchmarking. 
        Each discipline, classroom, and school demanded specific approaches in the tasks. 
    </h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        After some experiment UI experiments and heuristic evaluation, 
        we decided on an always visible filtering feature.
    </p>
    <div class="single-images">
        <figure>

    </div>
     <div class="source">
        From left to right: wireframes with possible 
        filter interfaces and the final choice. 
     </div>
    <h6>Sharing and applying</h6>
    <h4>
        The offline flow to apply the list created in our product is 
        a delicate point. We're instructing teachers in detail to 
        keep them in control of the tool
    </h4>
    <p class="article-text">
        Any moment the students get distracted could 
        be associated with the use of the product. 
    </p>
    <div class="single-images">

        </figure>
    </div>
   <div class="source">We started with a possible saving modal, 
       but we're trying to padronize interactions like this in fullscreen. 
       Also considered a page tho edit and save in the same moment, 
       but the flows where different enough to be separated.

        Most of the components used on the UI come from a shared library. 
        Here are the new ones, created for the search tool.

    <h6>Discoveries and the future</h6>
    <h4>
        We are tracking retention rate to measure our success 
        and I've conducting user interviews and usability 
        tests do improve the experience
    </h4>
        <p class="article-text">
            During the development phase, the user interviews pointed out that 
            the belief in the absence of the teacher's interest in bringing technology 
            to the classroom may be a myth. We have the hypothesis that the time to 
            discover and learn about digital tools is the real problem. In this scenario, 
            I'm working in an experiment to empower teachers to use Descomplica tools: 
            the Descomplica Methodologies (soon).
