            About VTEX
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            VTEX is a e-commerce platform that helps 
            brands as Carrefour and Samsumg to manage 
            their digital business end to end. From catalog 
            managing to storefront updates.
        </p>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            At VTEX I worked on a very broad problem: how to ensure 
            VTEXâ€™s clients were updating their stores at the recurrency 
            they needed without losing quality. The main product I 
            designed for that was Releases.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
        <h6>The problem</h6>
        <h4>
            Dozens of storefront updates go live daily, immediately 
            after editing. Without any review or testing.
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            The marketing and business team are responsible for 
            changing the business to follow certain decisions Sometimes 
            products go live with the wrong price, or promotions with 
            poor setup harm the expected conversion among other problems. 
            Our clientâ€™s business loses credibility. 
        </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="text-container">
        <h6>The idea</h6>
        <h4>
            A version management tool for non-technical users 
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Release would allow businesses to manage the updates 
            and changes they make to their online store and 
            to easily track and organize the different versions. 
            This way, the non-technical users could always see when 
            something would change and, with that, ensure that their 
            website is always up-to-date and running smoothly.

                <h5>What is the client routine?</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    I had to undestand what motivated the changes, who was 
                    responsible for them and how often they happened.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h5>How do other products solve this problem?</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    Mostly of the insights to design Releases came 
                    from Benchmark. I had to understand what to do or not.

                <h5>What layout will help users undertand the concept?</h5>
                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    Release managing was not trivial to the business 
                    users. I had to explore many layouts to decide.

        <h4>
            Timeline and Calendar view
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            In that circumstance, we were aiming for the ideal 
            experience â€” to scope out an MVP.and I explored many 
            different UIs, and picked one to test with users.

            Conclusion
        </h6>
        <h4>
            The ideal solution would be a calendar visualization. 
            But we needed to take small steps.
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Users always mentioned a calendar. They said would be the best 
            way to visualize their releases. After all the user research, 
            and gathering some feedback from the design team, 
            I got to the calendar layout.
        </p>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            But implementing it would require too much effort. To solve 
            that, I specified the implementation in stages, showing how 
            we could get to the ideal scenario.

            Visual explorations and user research

            <p class="sans-serif-text">
                The MVP scope based on user research:
            </p>
            <li>
                Create releases (group of updates to go live)
            </li>
            <li>
                Schedule Releases
            </li>
            <li>
                Add updates from one other VTEX tool (the CMS)
            </li>
            <li>
                See the updates inside each release

            Getting to the ideal
        </h6>
        <h4>
            I prototyped how the product should 
            be three months after the MVP release
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            After a few months, users should be able to switch 
            from a table visualization to a list visualization. 
            This small step should already help them to better see whatâ€™s to come.

            to choose the best view for their use cases
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            Users would have monthly, weekly, and daily calendar views. 
            It would be helpfull depending on the number os releases theyâ€™d 
            do in a daily basis. If there are many releases, the day 
            visualization should help them to have a clear understanding of what comes next.

            Final thoughts
        </h4>
        <p class="sans-serif-text">
            There are situations where we can create something that 
            goes beyond the "as simple as possible". Releases were designed for 
            a company that has an established Design System, which helped get the 
            MVP live fast. But the table format didn't fit the user's expectations, 
            and, as a designer, it was my job to scope the visual changes in a way it 
            would fit the sprint, to deliver the best experience possible with 
            one step after another.
