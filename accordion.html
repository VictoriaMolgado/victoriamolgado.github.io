        <dt><a href="">01. Questions to build together</a></dt>
            <dd>Understanding the business componentes is a key step in my working process. It's about going beyond the project scope, for the context. If the answers don't exist, we can build them together.
             </dd>
        <dt><a href="">02. Start by making</a></dt>
             <dd>The best way to start anything is to do it. Framing problems and putting things on paper: the path is the result, iterated and shaped by many hands. There will not be a flash of creativity - the possibilities need to be discovered with a lot of work.
              </dd>
        <dt><a href="">03. Listening for real collaboration</a></dt>
             <dd>Real collaboration is a result of good ears. Doesn't matter what fraction of the job we are talking about, listen to what other people have to say, their opinions and suggestions are valuable until the opposite is proved.
