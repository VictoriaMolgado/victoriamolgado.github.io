            <h6>This is about me, because is about what I believe and live</h6>
            <p>Design is a thinking technique, a framework to process information and transform it into solutions, actions. From my last three years working as product designer, I proudly sustain the conclusion that my job is to serve as the connection between this processing and people.
                </p>
            <p>If I receive a problem, a message to translate, the first thing to do is pay attention carefully to what is being said and extract the real issue. Then, I start to bring ideias to the world â€” on paper â€” and do my thing ðŸ˜Ž: translate Design to the world, Design to the other professionals creating the product with me.
                </p>
            <h2>[...] I start to bring ideias to the world â€” on paper â€” and do my thing: translate the problem to the world using Design.</h2>
            <p>To ensure the best translation I need a holistic view of the scenario and understand a little bit of all the business parts and elements. Therefore, I ask - hows, whys, whos and how manys, I will ask until the doubts are over and, more than that, the guesses.
                </p>
            <h2>To ensure the best translation I need a holistic vision of the scenario [...] I will ask until the doubts are over and, more than that, the guesses.</h2>
            <p>My career makes me feel grateful. I appreciate my design-to-world mediator privileges to work with extraordinary people in understanding, grinding and solving problems. My approach to design is not a step in product creation, but the elo that connects problems, possibilities and people.

            <h1>Ok, ok, letâ€™s </br> <span class="h1-pink">talk about me</span> </h1>
            <p>Brasilian designer, graduated by UFRJ, I'm 24 years old and started my user experience studies 4 years ago. I founded in UX my passion in the design field and today I'm grateful for work in digital products since the conception to the real world use. To do so, I carry with me three key-steps in the design process:

            <h3 class="key-step"><span class="key-step-active">âœ¢</span>01. Questions to build togethergit</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">Understanding the business componentes is a key step in my working process. It's about going beyond the project scope, for the context. If the answers don't exist, we can build then together.

            <h3 class="key-step"><span class="key-step-active">âœ¢</span>02. Start by making</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">The best way to start anything is to do it. Framing problems and putting things on paper: the path is the result, iterative and shaped by many hands. There will not be a flash of creativity - the possibilities need to be discovered with a lot of work.

            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">Real collaboration is a result of good ears. Doesn't matter what fraction of the job we are talking, listen to what other people have to say, their opinions and suggestions are valuable until the opposite is proved.
