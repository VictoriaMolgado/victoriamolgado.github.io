            <h1 class="description">Me, design translator and professional <span class="h1-pink">questioner âœ¢</span></h1>
            <h6>This is about my process, my beliefs and practice: things that I like to keep together.</h6>
            <p>Design is a thinking technique, a framework to process information and transform it into solutions, actions. From my last three years working as a product designer, I proudly sustain the conclusion that my job is to serve as the connection between this processing and people.
                </p>
            <p>If I receive a problem, a message to translate, the first thing to do is to pay attention carefully to what is being said and extract the real issue. Then, I start to bring ideas to the world â€” on paper â€” and do my thing ðŸ˜Ž:  translate Design to the world, translating it to my coworkers creating the product with me.
                </p>
            <h2>[...] I start to bring ideas to the world â€” on paper â€” and do my thing:  translate Design to .</h2>
            <p>To ensure the best translation I need a holistic view of the scenario and to understand a little bit of all the business parts and elements. Therefore, I ask - hows, whys, whos and how manys, I will ask until the doubts are over and, more than that, the guesses.
                </p>
            <h2>To ensure the best translation I need a holistic vision of the scenario [...] I will ask until the doubts are over and, more than that, the guesses.</h2>
            <p>Today my career makes me feel grateful. I appreciate my privileges as a design-to-world mediator and being able to work with extraordinary people to understand, grind and solve problems. My approach to design is not a step in product creation, but the link that connects problems, possibilities and people.
                </p>
            <h1>Ok, ok, letâ€™s </br> <span class="h1-pink">talk about me</span> </h1>
            <p> Brasilian designer graduated at UFRJ, I'm 24 years old and started my user experience studies 4 years ago. I found in UX my passion in the design field, and today I'm grateful to work in digital products, from the conception to the real-world use. To do so, I carry with me three key-steps in the design process:
                </p>
            <h3 class="key-step"><span class="key-step-active">âœ¢</span>01. Creating together by asking</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">Understanding business segments is a key step in my working process. It's about going beyond the project scope, for the context. If the answers don't exist, we can build them together.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="key-step"><span class="key-step-active">âœ¢</span>02. Start by making</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">The best way to start anything is to do it. Framing problems and putting things on paper: the path is the result, iterated and shaped by many hands. There will not be a creativity flashlight  - the possibilities need to be discovered with a lot of work
                    </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="key-step"><span class="key-step-active">âœ¢</span>03. Listening for real collaboration</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">Real collaboration results from good ears. It doesn't matter what fraction of the job we are talking about, listen to what other people have to say, their opinions and suggestions are valuable until the opposite is proved.
