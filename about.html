            <h6>This is about me, because is about what I believe and live</h6>
            <p>From my last three years experience working in digital products I stand a conclusion: Design is a way of thinking and processing information - my job is to be the communication between this processing and people.
                </p>
            <p>I receive problems and translate them into solutions, listen to executives, developers and managers ideas to transform them in products. My role is translate the Design to the world and vice-versa. 
                </p>
            <h2>[...] receive problems and translate them in solutions [...] my role is translate Design to the world and vice versa</h2>
            <p>To ensure the best translation I need a holistic vision of the scenario and understand a little of everything that constitutes the problem. Therefore, I ask - hows, whys, whos and how manys, I will ask until the doubts are over and, more than that, the guesses.

            <h2>To ensure the best translation I need a holistic vision of the scenario [...] I will ask until the doubts are over and, more than that, the guesses.</h2>
            <p>I'm here, in love with my career, but with both feet on the ground. I appreciate the privilege of being a mediator between understanding the problem, grinding it and solving it with the help of extraordinary people. I'm not just a part of this system, i'm the elo that takes the problems to the possibilities - that come with people.

            <h1>Ok, ok, letâ€™s </br> <span class="h1-pink">talk about me</span> </h1>
            <p>Brasilian designer, graduated by UFRJ, I'm 24 years old and started my user experience studies 4 years ago. I founded in UX my passion in the design field and today I'm grateful for work in digital products since the conception to the real world use. To do so, I carry with me three key-steps in the design process:
                </p>
            <h3 class="key-step"><a>01. To question</a></h3>
            <p class="pilar">To understand at least a little bit of evertyghint is a key piece to me. This is not only about the project scope: it's why are we doing it? What is our real problem? What are our resources? - but also about how can I communicate with the final user? What are th - the base of my work process are questions and the result is nothing more than ther answers.
                </p>
            <h3 class="key-step">02. Start by making</h3>
            <p class="pilar">The best way to start anything is to do it. Framing problems and putting things on paper: the path is the result, iterative and shaped by many hands. There will not be a flash of creativity - the possibilities need to be discovered with a lot of work.
                </p>
            <h3 class="key-step">03. Collaborate</h3>
            <p class="pilar">Real collaboration is a result of good ears. Doesn't matter what fraction of the job we are talking, listen to what other people have to say, their opinions and suggestions are valuable until the opposite is proved.
