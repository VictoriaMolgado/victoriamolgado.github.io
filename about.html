    <h1 class="description">Me, design translator and professional questioner âœ¢</h1>
    <h6>This is about me, because is about what I believe and live</h6>
    <p>From my last three years experience working in digital products I stand a conclusion: Design is a way of thinking and processing information - my job is to be the communication between this processing and people.
        I receive problems and translate them into solutions, listen to executives, developers and managers ideas to transform them in products. My role is translate the Design to the world and vice-versa. 
        To ensure the best translation I need a holistic vision of the scenario and understand a little of everything that constitutes the problem. Therefore, I ask - hows, whys, whos and how manys, I will ask until the doubts are over and, more than that, the guesses.
        I'm here, in love with my career, but with both feet on the ground. I appreciate the privilege of being a mediator between understanding the problem, grinding it and solving it with the help of extraordinary people. I'm not just a part of this system, i'm the elo that takes the problems to the possibilities - that come with people. 
        </p>
