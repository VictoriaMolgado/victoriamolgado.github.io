                Me, design translator and professional 
                <span class="h1-pink">questioner âœ¢</span></h1>
            <p>
                Design is a framework to process information and transform it into solutions, 
                actions. From my last three years working as a product designer, I sustain 
                the conclusion that my job is to serve as the connection between this 
                processing and people, translate the design to the world.
            </p>
           <h4 class="about-h4">
                I trust in my translating process to guarantee collaboration 
                and alignment, in four practices
           </h4>

                </figure>
            </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="source">
                    More about the roots of these practices in my three design 
                    principles, down on this page.

            <h4 class="about-h4">
                And, to ensure the best translation I need a holistic 
                view of the business scenario
            </h4>
            <p>
                Therefore, I ask - hows, whys, whos and how many, 
                I will ask until the doubts are over and, more than that, the guesses.
            </p>
            <h4 class="about-h4">Working makes me happy. Should I worry?</h4>
            <p>
                My career makes me feel grateful. I appreciate being 
                a design-to-world mediator to work with extraordinary
                people understanding, grinding and solving problems together.

        <h1>Ok, ok, letâ€™s </br> <span class="h1-pink">talk about me</span> </h1>
        <p> 
            I am a Brasilian designer graduated at UFRJ, I'm 24 years old and 
            started my user experience studies 4 years ago. I found in UX my 
            passion in the design field, and today I'm grateful to work in 
            digital products, from the conception to the real-world use. 
            To do so, I have three principles which I resort to manage myself:
        </p>
            <h3 class="key-step">01. Creating together by asking</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">
                    Understanding business segments is a key step in my 
                    working process. It's about going beyond the project 
                    scope, for the context. If the answers don't exist, 
                    we can build them together.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="key-step">02. Start by making</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">
                    The best way to start anything is to do it. Framing 
                    problems and putting things on paper: the path is the 
                    result, iterated and shaped by many hands. There will 
                    not be a creativity flashlight  - the possibilities need 
                    to be discovered with a lot of work
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="key-step">03. Listening for real collaboration</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p class="pilar">
                    Real collaboration results from good ears. It doesn't 
                    matter what fraction of the job we are talking about, 
                    listen to what other people have to say, their opinions 
                    and suggestions are valuable until the opposite is proved.
